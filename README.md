# Uber-Trip-Analysis-Using-Machine-learning

---

#### **Project Description**

This project focuses on analyzing **Uber trip data** from New York City to identify patterns, trends, and key factors influencing trip demand. Using machine learning techniques, the project aims to build predictive models that can forecast Uber trip demand, helping optimize operations and improve customer satisfaction.

The dataset includes **4.5 million Uber pickups** from April to September 2014 and **14.3 million pickups** from January to June 2015. The analysis covers various aspects such as **peak demand periods**, **geographical hotspots**, and **seasonal trends**. Machine learning models like **Random Forest Regressor**, **XGBoost**, and **Gradient Boosted Regression Trees (GBRT)** are used to predict trip demand, with an **ensemble model** combining the strengths of all three.

---

#### **Key Features**

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and transforming raw Uber trip data for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing trends, peak demand periods, and popular pickup locations.
- **Feature Engineering**: Extracting meaningful features like hour, day of the week, and month from the dataset.
- **Model Building**: Training and evaluating machine learning models to predict trip demand.
- **Ensemble Modeling**: Combining predictions from multiple models to improve accuracy.
- **Visualization**: Creating insightful visualizations to communicate findings and model performance.

---

#### **Technologies Used**

- **Programming Languages**: Python
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn, XGBoost
- **Tools**: Jupyter Notebook, VS Code
- **Domain**: Data Analysis, Machine Learning, Time Series Forecasting

#### **Dataset**

The dataset used in this project is sourced from the **NYC Taxi & Limousine Commission (TLC)** and includes:

- **Uber Trip Data**: Detailed pickup information (date/time, latitude, longitude, base code).
- **Non-Uber FHV Data**: Trip information from 10 other for-hire vehicle companies.
- **Aggregate Statistics**: Daily pickup data for 329 FHV companies.

#### **Project Structure**

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Identifying trends and patterns in Uber trip data.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features for model training.
4. **Model Building**: Training and evaluating machine learning models.
5. **Ensemble Modeling**: Combining models to improve prediction accuracy.
6. **Visualization**: Creating plots and charts to communicate insights.

#### **Results**

- **XGBoost** achieved the best performance with a **Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)** of **8.37%**.
- The **ensemble model** achieved a MAPE of **8.60%**, combining the strengths of XGBoost, Random Forest, and GBRT.
- Key insights include **peak demand during evening rush hours** and **higher trip volumes on weekends**.
