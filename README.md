# Uber-Trip-Analysis-Using-Machine-learning

---
### **Uber Trip Analysis Machine Learning Project**

---

#### **Project Description**

This project dives into **Uber trip data** from New York City to uncover patterns, trends, and insights that can help predict trip demand. By analyzing millions of Uber pickups, we aim to build machine learning models that can forecast when and where demand will be highest. This kind of analysis is crucial for optimizing operations, improving customer experiences, and making data-driven decisions.

The dataset includes **4.5 million Uber pickups** from April to September 2014 and **14.3 million pickups** from January to June 2015. We explore everything from **peak demand times** to **popular pickup locations**, and even predict future trip demand using advanced machine learning techniques like **Random Forest**, **XGBoost**, and **Gradient Boosted Regression Trees (GBRT)**. To boost accuracy, we also combine these models into an **ensemble model**.

#### **Whatâ€™s Inside?**

- **Data Cleaning & Prep**: We start by cleaning and organizing the raw Uber trip data to make it ready for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: We visualize the data to uncover trends, like when and where Uber trips are most frequent.
- **Feature Engineering**: We extract useful information from the data, such as the hour of the day, day of the week, and month, to help our models make better predictions.
- **Model Building**: We train and test machine learning models to predict trip demand.
- **Ensemble Modeling**: We combine the predictions from multiple models to create a more accurate forecast.
- **Visualizations**: We create clear and insightful charts to communicate our findings.

#### **Tools & Technologies**

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn, XGBoost
- **Tools**: Jupyter Notebook, VS Code
- **Domain**: Data Analysis, Machine Learning, Time Series Forecasting

#### **Dataset**

The data comes from the **NYC Taxi & Limousine Commission (TLC)** and includes:

- **Uber Trip Data**: Details like pickup times, locations (latitude/longitude), and base codes.
- **Non-Uber Data**: Trip information from other for-hire vehicle companies.
- **Aggregate Stats**: Daily pickup data for hundreds of companies.

This dataset was originally used in **FiveThirtyEight** stories to analyze Uber's impact on NYC traffic, transit, and competition with traditional taxis.

#### **Key Insights**

- **Peak Demand**: The busiest times are during **evening rush hours (5 PM - 8 PM)** and on **weekends**.
- **Popular Locations**: Most pickups happen in **Manhattan**, with significant activity in **Brooklyn** and **Queens**.
- **Best Model**: **XGBoost** performed the best, with a **Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)** of **8.37%**.
- **Ensemble Model**: By combining XGBoost, Random Forest, and GBRT, we achieved a MAPE of **8.60%**, making our predictions even more reliable.

#### **Why This Matters**

Understanding trip demand isnâ€™t just about numbersâ€”itâ€™s about improving the experience for both drivers and riders. By predicting when and where demand will be highest, Uber can allocate resources more efficiently, reduce wait times, and even adjust pricing dynamically. This project is a step toward making ride-sharing smarter and more responsive to real-world needs.
